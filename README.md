## [Forecasting Loan Default](https://github.com/cwc63/Portfolio/blob/master/Forecasting%20Loan%20Default/DScamp_unit3%2Bcapstone.ipynb)

Overview:  The aftermath of the 2008 subprime mortgage crisis has caused huge damages to world economy and society. It raises importance of retail credit for consumers. Using Data Science, Data Mining, Exploratory Data Analysis and Machine Learning, we will investigate the issue in detail and try to predict if an individual is likely to default on a loan or not by applying Random forest, Decision Tree and Support Vector Machine.
